# landing-page

This is my work from The Odin Project's Landing Page project.

This project was a struggle for me.  I've been trying to work on this for over a month now, a little bit at a time.  One thing I've learned from this project, which may have been the point, was that web development is a constant exercise in troubleshooting and problem-solving.  My finished product is the result of extensive trial and error which at times felt more like guess and check.  In the end, I'm happy with the finished product, but looking forward to coming back to this in the future and refining it with information and skills I pick up while completing The Odin Project.
